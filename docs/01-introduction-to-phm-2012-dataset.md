# Introduction to PHM 2012 Dataset

The following key points were extracted from the official documentation [IEEE-PHM2012-Challenge-Details](../phm2012/assets/IEEE-PHM2012-Challenge-Details.pdf).

## Feature

The raw dataset contains 2 types of features: `vibration` and `temperature`. Each type of feature is logged with timestamps in different resolution.

| | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 | Column 5 | Column 6 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Vibration Signal** | Hour | Minute | Second | Î¼-second    | Horiz. accel. | vert. accel. |
| **Temparature Signal** | Hour | Minute | Second | 1/10 second | Rtd sensor | - |

## Operating Condition

There are also 3 operating conditions provided.

1. 1800 rpm and 4000 N
2. 1650 rpm and 4200 N
3. 1500 rpm and 5000 N

## Training Instance

3 conditions * 2 instances per condition = 6 run-to-failure dataset instances
